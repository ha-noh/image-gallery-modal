# image-gallery-modal
 A module that can be added to a webpage to create an image gallery with modal views on click. It's written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript without any additional libraries or frameworks.

## Why I made this
While there are plenty of tutorials and examples of image galleries that open a bigger view when one of its images is clicked, the ones that I found weren't quite what I was looking for in terms of modularity and scalability. 

Ideally this module can be inserted into any webpage (with some adjustments), and will create the necessary html without the user having to create a separate element, and specify a unique source address, for every modal image. As the gallery grows, it shouldn't become more tedious to add additional images. Automation is the dream.

## Plan
1) gallery-module.html, gallery-module.css, gallery-module.js
2) Maybe have two sets, one for a version where [A] the module builds the gallery from scratch, and [B] one where it controls only the modals, and overlays it on top of the webpage.
