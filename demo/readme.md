# Running the demo
1. Open Command Prompt (or another terminal), navigate to the image-gallery-modal directory, e.g. `cd documents/github/image-gallery-modal`, or wherever the directory is located on your system.
2. From this location run `python -m http.server 8000`, changing the port number at the end as needed. The syntax might differ slightly based on your version of Python.

# Dependencies
You will need Python installed to run this *demo* properly, as the jQuery required to retrieve the html must be called over a http connection. You **do not** need Python to use this module in your own webpage, only for this demo. 

# Sorry,
this is the best solution I could come up with to have a demo that reuses the up to date code in the main directory. It's not elegant, I know :(.
